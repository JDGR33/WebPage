            <h2>Building with AI #0 – Series of Short Posts</h2>
            <p>Over the last year, I’ve been learning, building, and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as part of my work as an Analyst for AI Solutions at MEG. I’m writing a series of short posts, Building with AI, where I’ll be sharing key insights and practical knowledge about working with LLMs. Whether you’re curious about integrating AI into your projects or want to learn how to solve specific problems using LLMs, this series will serve as your starting point.</p>
            <p>Each post will cover a fundamental concept, giving you the foundation you need to begin experimenting with LLMs. While I’ll assume you have some basic programming knowledge. By the end of the series, I hope you’ll have a clearer understanding of the kinds of projects you can create with LLMs and know where to find the resources to turn those ideas into reality.</p>
